*Configuring the Validation Bean Post Processor*
Inspektr utilizes annotations to handle its Inversion of Control dependency validation (i.e. whether you supplied the correct dependencies).  These annotations are checked using a BeanPostProcessor configured in your application's Spring configuration file.  You can add an entry like this:

<bean id="validationAnnotationBeanPostProcessor" class="org.inspektr.common.ioc.validation.!ValidationAnnotationBeanPostProcessor" />
